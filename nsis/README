Nullsoft Installer System (NSIS) installer scripts
==========================================================

This directory consists of various scripts for compiling GNUstep on Windows
and creating installer scripts. This is not really a plug-and-play system - 
significant setup and editing of scripts is necessary if you want to create
something from scratch.

Here's a basic overview of what needs to be done currently:

1. Download compiled packages from www.mingw.org and put them in the
"sources/mingw" directory (still tar'd and compressed). Install them as well
(on Windows and the packages directory). See DOWNLOADS for a list

Use native-mingw-install.sh  to help with this.

2. Download source packages from wherever they are located and put them
in the "sources" directory. Compile them on Windows or cross-compile them.
Install them. Also install all the files to a separate install directory
for each package in the "pakages" directory. For instance, you might
put the libxml package in the packages directory like this:

CURRENT=`pwd`
cd $CURRENT/sources/libxml2-2.6.30
mkdir -p $CURRENT/packages/libxml2
make DESTDIR=$CURRENT/packages/libxml2 install

For my particular setup, I use the following scripts to native compile all
the packages and create the package lists in the packages directory.  

native-compile.sh (or svn-compile.sh)

3. Use the create_script.sh script to generate the file lists needed for the
installer. Use the argument "system", or "core" to generate the 
lists for the indicated installer.

4. Replace the file lists in the current installer scripts with the new
file lists.  You need to edit the RMDir lines to make sure dirs
are being deleted in the proper order and not multiple times.

5. Run the NSIS installer compiler to generate the package. You can get it
from nsis.sourceforge.net (There is even a version for Unix, but they require
a cross compiler and don't support plugins).
