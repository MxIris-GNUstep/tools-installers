Nullsoft Installer System (NSIS) installer scripts
==========================================================

This directory consists of various scripts for compiling GNUstep on Windows
and creating installer scripts. This is not really a plug-and-play system - 
significant setup and editing of scripts is necessary if you want to create
something from scratch.

Here's a basic overview of what needs to be done currently:

1. Download compiled packags from www.mingw.org and put them in the
"packages" directory (still tar'd and compressed). Install them as well

2. Download source packages from wherever they are located and put them
in the "sources" directory. Compile them on Windows or cross-compile them.
Install them. Also copy/tar all the files to a separate install directory
for each package in the "pakages" directory. For instantance, you might
put the libxml package in the packages directory like this:

cd sources/libxml2-2.6.30
mkdir -p $HOME/nsis/packages/libxml2-2.6.30
make DESTDIR=$HOME/nsis/packages/libxml2-2.6.30 install

3. Use the create_script.sh script to generate the file lists needed for the
installer. Use the argument "system", "depend", or "core" to generate the 
lists for the indicated intaller.

4. Replace the file lists in the current installer scripts with the new
file lists

4. Run the NSIS installer compiler to generate the package. You can get it
from nsis.sourceforge.net (There are even version for Unix, but they require
a cross compiler and don't support plugins).
